# Repository Rules

## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: THESE RULES MUST BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT EXCEPTION

1. **ABSOLUTELY NO NEW BRANCHES AT ALL**
   - Only use the main branch
   - NEVER EVER create or push ANY additional branches
   - NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

2. **ALWAYS CONFIRM BEFORE PUSHING**
   - Never use `--force` without specific permission
   - Always explain what changes will be pushed

3. **NO MODIFICATIONS TO DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS**
   - Do not modify Vercel configuration
   - Do not change GitHub workflows
   - Do not alter deployment targets

4. **COMMIT MESSAGES**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Always prefix with appropriate type: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, etc.
   - Example: `fix: resolve login redirection issue`

5. **CODE STANDARDS**
   - Maintain existing code style and patterns
   - Run linters before committing
   - Ensure tests pass before pushing

6. **REPOSITORY STRUCTURE**
   - Maintain the existing file organization
   - Do not reorganize directories without permission

7. **DEPENDENCIES**
   - Do not add new dependencies without permission
   - Do not upgrade major versions of existing dependencies

8. **FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY**
   - ANY instruction given must be followed PRECISELY
   - Do not deviate from explicit instructions for ANY reason
   - If an instruction says "don't do X" - never do X under any circumstance
   - Re-read instructions multiple times to ensure complete understanding
   - Ask for clarification if instructions are unclear, but NEVER proceed with an action that contradicts a direct instruction

These rules are ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY. Failure to follow them will result in broken deployments and repository issues.
